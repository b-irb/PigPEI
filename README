PigPEI is a simple UEFI bootkit which can intercept DxeMain by running
as PEIM during the PEI phase. As a consequence, PigPEI is able to fully
control DxeMain initialisation and later stages of boot.

PigPEI does not do anything exciting. The bootkit installs a single
persistent hook to write to UART when ExitBootServices() is called.
However, it is very straightforward to add additional hooks to manipulate
the OS (e.g. intercepting GetVariable attempting to read SecureBoot)
or privileged DXE modules in SMRAM.

PigPEI is limited to OvmfPkg so it will not work out of the box for real
firmware images. If you want to make it work on real devices then you
are free to modify the old FFS injector and play around with the code.

To build and run PigPEI in an emulator:
$ ./run.sh

You will have to compile OVMF then put the necessary files in ./fv.
If you do not know what that means then this project is not for you.
